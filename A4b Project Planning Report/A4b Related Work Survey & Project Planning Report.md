### Deliverables & Milestones
> Milestone 1: **Literature Review & Technology Selection** milestone 1 is expected to be met by progress report 1. We are expecting to have a comprehensive literature review on [_SDN_](#software-defined-networking), [_Load Balancing_](#load-balancing) and _Telemetry Technologies_
>
> Milestone 2: **System Architecture Design** we expect to have a detailed system architecture diagram outlining component interactions & data flow.
>
> Milestone 3: **Telemetry Data Collection & Processing** we expect to complete milestone 3 by progress reports 3 and 4. At this stage documentation for a prototype system to collect and process incoming network telemetry data from [_OVS_]() instances using [_GoFlow2_]().
>
> Milestone 4: **Load Balancing Algorithm Development** by the 5th and final reports we expect to have finalized the documentation and begin the development of the prototype load balancing algorithm.
>
> Milestone 5: **Integration & Testing** at this stage in second semester of the project we are striving to integrate the prototype load balancer with the [_SDN_](#software-defined-networking) controller and [_OVS_]() instances.
>
> Milestone 6: **Performace Evaluation** at this stage in the second semester we will evaluate the performance of the prototype load balancer using tools like [_Docker_]() containerization for deploying [_Mininet_]() instances to generate simulated network traffic.
>
> Milestone 7: **Refinement & Optimization** we will strive at this point to iteratively refine the prototype load balancer's algorithm and system architecture based on the performance evaluation results.
>
> Milestone 8: **Final Prototype Demonstration** At the end of the second semester we will strive to have a completed prototype that is ready to deploy and showcase.

## Conclusion
