we want to mimic the functionality of a load balancer
we should call it a simplified load balancer
explicitly express our idea
how to make this work in a system
we understand the general structure and how to prototype the idea
- redesign the Kafka consumer to use a load balancing algorithm
- update the proposal
- we need to add in some of the missing details of the core functionality of the system but we cannot give all the tiny details
- we cannot form the algorithmic design of the entire project
- more meetings to figure out design
- first discussion of design
